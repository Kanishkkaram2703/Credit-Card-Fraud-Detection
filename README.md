# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

1. Import Libraries:

Load essential Python libraries to handle data (like pandas and numpy), visualize trends (using matplotlib and seaborn), and implement machine learning algorithms (sklearn).
2. Load and Explore Dataset:

Load the credit card transaction data, which typically includes features like transaction amount, time, and various anonymized features.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and get a sense of the distribution between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
3. Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing values, if present. In fraud detection, every data point is crucial, so missing values might need imputation or removal depending on their significance.
Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model’s learning process.
Convert categorical variables into dummy variables (one-hot encoding) if needed.
4. Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This split allows the model to be evaluated on unseen data, ensuring its robustness.
Due to the imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets (fraudulent transactions are much fewer than non-fraudulent ones), consider using techniques like stratified sampling to maintain the same distribution of classes in both training and test sets.
5. Handle Class Imbalance:

Since fraudulent transactions are rare, the dataset will be imbalanced. Address this imbalance using techniques such as oversampling the minority class (fraud cases) or undersampling the majority class (non-fraud cases). Alternatively, algorithms like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be applied to generate synthetic samples of the minority class.
6. Model Training:

Train multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
During training, consider using cross-validation to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.
7. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using metrics appropriate for imbalanced datasets, such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC).
The focus should be on minimizing false negatives (fraudulent transactions classified as non-fraudulent) while keeping false positives (non-fraudulent transactions classified as fraudulent) low enough to maintain user trust.
8. Model Deployment and Monitoring:

Once the best-performing model is identified, it can be deployed in a real-time environment where incoming transactions are flagged as fraudulent or not.
Continuous monitoring of the model’s performance is essential, as the nature of fraud can evolve, requiring periodic retraining of the model with new data.
